Very Basic Info Stealer

This is a very basic info stealer written in python intended to be compiled with PyInstaller to a portable executable. It is loud and flagged by 20/71 vendors on VirusTotal.

This was made as a POC and lightweight info stealer. It gathers browser, discord, and steam info and exfiltrates the data over http to a flask app.
